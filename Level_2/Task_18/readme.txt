Hello I was a bit confused on the questions. 
I said to create a template to display information about me I created a basic html fill called index.html because standard is that the main page should be called index.
You are able to click to the two different tasks that include task 17 and 16. Now the question never said to include css or images, but I did include all the css and most images. I just didn't for my task 17 the product image because it would take too long but I believe I did demonstrate my capabilities that I am able to do it. 
I also used a virtual environment to where I installed django on. env/scripts/activate.


Note: pip install django before running batch file

                Who am I
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am introverted person that enjoys time spent with people that are are close to me, mainly family. I tend to be fair and be non biased rather siding with what I feel is right.

                What's my experience
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have a wide range of experience. I worded as a boilermaker for around 6 years and have been studying code in my free time for about 2 years. I have also created two blogs and know quite a bit about SEO. I have also made a few wordpress sites for clients and currently working on ine. 
                I grew up in Mozambique where I have worked and met a lot of people from a lot of different cultures. I tend to get a long with most people and be very respectful to everyone around me.

            <h3>
                My motives
            </h3>
            <p>
                I love to learn new things and I really enjoy coding. I always try to do extra and not just what is required. I will really like to work in the gaming industry not just because I like to play games I would actually say I tend to barely play games. But because there is a lot of logic that goes into creating games and I enjoy the process.
